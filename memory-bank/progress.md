# Progress

## What Works

### Current Implementation
- **Basic Structure**: Project has README.md with clear documentation
- **TestCase Class**: Complete with YAML parsing and file loading
- **File Loading**: Robust file parsing with whitespace preservation
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for all functionality
- **Example Implementation**: FizzBuzz example demonstrates usage pattern
- **Test Case Format**: YAML + input format is well-defined and working

### Validated Concepts
- **Structured Test Files**: YAML header approach is working perfectly
- **TDD Workflow**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle is established and effective
- **Minimal Setup**: Copy-paste input file approach is simple and reliable
- **Dart Integration**: Native test framework integration is solid
- **File Parsing**: `---\n` separator approach works cleanly
- **Whitespace Preservation**: Critical for AOC input fidelity

## What's Left to Build

### Core Features
- **Test Runner Implementation**: Core Dart test runner functionality
- **Test Execution**: Run tests and compare actual vs expected output
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed tests
- **Refactoring**: Extract parsing logic to `fromString` method for better test isolation

### Developer Experience
- **Clear Examples**: More comprehensive example implementations
- **Error Messages**: Helpful feedback when tests fail
- **Documentation**: API reference and advanced usage patterns
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast test execution

## Current Status

### Phase: TDD Implementation - Phase 2 Complete
- **Memory Bank**: Established comprehensive project context
- **User Research**: Identified target users and pain points
- **Value Proposition**: Clear understanding of competitive advantages
- **Technical Direction**: Dart-based approach with YAML test cases
- **Collaboration Mode**: Mob programming approach established and working effectively
- **TDD Foundation**: Two complete cycles with robust TestCase implementation
- **File Loading**: Complete file parsing with AOC input fidelity

### Completed Milestone: TestCase Implementation
- **Dart Project Structure**: ✅ Complete with proper dependencies
- **TDD Foundation**: ✅ Test framework working for test runner itself
- **TestCase Class**: ✅ YAML parsing with factory constructor
- **Learning Success**: ✅ Stefan learned Dart constructors, factory methods, type handling
- **Clean Commit**: ✅ Working increment committed with proper git practices

### Completed Milestone: File Loading Implementation
- **File I/O**: ✅ Complete file loading with `TestCase.fromFile()`
- **Whitespace Preservation**: ✅ Exact AOC input fidelity maintained
- **Test Coverage**: ✅ Comprehensive tests for file loading and whitespace
- **Learning Success**: ✅ Stefan learned file I/O, string splitting, whitespace handling
- **Clean Implementation**: ✅ All tests passing with robust file parsing

### Next Milestone: Test Execution Implementation
- **TDD Phase 3**: Implement test execution and output comparison
- **Refactoring**: Extract parsing logic to `fromString` method
- **Error Handling**: Add clear error messages for failed tests
- **Integration**: Create complete FizzBuzz example

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- **Test Execution**: Core test runner functionality needs development
- **Refactoring Needed**: Parsing logic should be extracted to `fromString` method
- **Limited Examples**: Only FizzBuzz example available
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing API reference and advanced patterns

### Technical Debt
- **Code Structure**: May need refactoring as features are added
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling not yet implemented
- **Testing**: Framework itself needs comprehensive testing
- **Documentation**: Examples and patterns need expansion

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach
- Started with general-purpose testing framework concept
- Focused on reducing boilerplate for any algorithmic problems

### Refined Focus
- Narrowed scope to Advent of Code puzzles specifically
- Emphasized competitive programming context and time pressure
- Positioned as alternative to Approval Testing with specialization

### Current Direction
- Personal growth project with clear technical goals
- Focus on existing TDD practitioners, not testing skeptics
- Validation through controlled time-based comparison
