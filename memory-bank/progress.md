# Progress

## What Works

### Current Implementation
- **Basic Structure**: Project has README.md with clear documentation
- **Example Implementation**: FizzBuzz example demonstrates usage pattern
- **Test Case Format**: YAML + input format is well-defined
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for setup and usage

### Validated Concepts
- **Structured Test Files**: YAML header approach is working
- **TDD Workflow**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle is established
- **Minimal Setup**: Copy-paste input file approach is simple
- **Dart Integration**: Native test framework integration is solid

## What's Left to Build

### Core Features
- **Test Runner Implementation**: Core Dart test runner functionality
- **YAML Parser**: Parse test case headers and extract metadata
- **File I/O**: Read test case files and input data
- **Test Execution**: Run tests and compare actual vs expected output
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed tests

### Developer Experience
- **Clear Examples**: More comprehensive example implementations
- **Error Messages**: Helpful feedback when tests fail
- **Documentation**: API reference and advanced usage patterns
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast test execution

## Current Status

### Phase: Product Vision & Planning
- **Memory Bank**: Established comprehensive project context
- **User Research**: Identified target users and pain points
- **Value Proposition**: Clear understanding of competitive advantages
- **Technical Direction**: Dart-based approach with YAML test cases

### Next Milestone: Technical Implementation
- **Code Analysis**: Examine existing codebase structure
- **Feature Planning**: Prioritize core features for implementation
- **Validation Strategy**: Plan controlled testing approach
- **Development Setup**: Ensure proper development environment

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- **Incomplete Implementation**: Core test runner functionality needs development
- **Limited Examples**: Only FizzBuzz example available
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing API reference and advanced patterns
- **Validation Needed**: No performance comparison with standard approaches

### Technical Debt
- **Code Structure**: May need refactoring as features are added
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling not yet implemented
- **Testing**: Framework itself needs comprehensive testing
- **Documentation**: Examples and patterns need expansion

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach
- Started with general-purpose testing framework concept
- Focused on reducing boilerplate for any algorithmic problems

### Refined Focus
- Narrowed scope to Advent of Code puzzles specifically
- Emphasized competitive programming context and time pressure
- Positioned as alternative to Approval Testing with specialization

### Current Direction
- Personal growth project with clear technical goals
- Focus on existing TDD practitioners, not testing skeptics
- Validation through controlled time-based comparison
