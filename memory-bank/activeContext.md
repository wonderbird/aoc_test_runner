# Active Context

## Current Focus

Exploring the product vision and business context for the aoc_test_runner project to establish a solid foundation for development.

## Recent Insights

### Key Discoveries
- **Target Users**: TDD practitioners who already value testing, not skeptics who need convincing
- **Core Value**: Reducing friction to start testing when puzzles become complex
- **Competitive Context**: Tool must feel like competitive advantage, not overhead
- **Personal Project**: Focused on personal growth and learning, not market expansion

### User Psychology
- Developers view testing as "waste of time" in competitive scenarios
- Hesitation to add tests comes from fear of losing momentum
- Success requires demonstrating that TDD actually makes them faster
- Minimal footprint is crucial for adoption

## Next Steps

1. **Technical Analysis**: Examine current codebase structure and implementation
2. **Feature Prioritization**: Identify core features vs. nice-to-have capabilities
3. **Validation Strategy**: Plan controlled testing with medium-difficulty AOC puzzles
4. **Documentation**: Create clear examples and usage patterns

## Active Decisions

- **Scope**: Focus on AOC puzzles specifically, not general algorithmic problems
- **Positioning**: Compete with Approval Testing by being more specialized
- **Validation**: Use time-based comparison with classic TDD approach
- **Target**: Existing TDD practitioners, not testing skeptics

## Important Patterns

- **Structured Test Files**: YAML header + raw input format
- **Minimal Setup**: Copy-paste input file, implement algorithm, run test
- **TDD Workflow**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
- **Competitive Advantage**: Speed through systematic testing approach
