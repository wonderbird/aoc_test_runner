# Active Context

## Current Focus

Implementing the aoc_test_runner using Test-Driven Development with Stefan as the typist and me as the navigator in a mob programming approach.

## Recent Insights

### Key Discoveries
- **Target Users**: TDD practitioners who already value testing, not skeptics who need convincing
- **Core Value**: Reducing friction to start testing when puzzles become complex
- **Competitive Context**: Tool must feel like competitive advantage, not overhead
- **Personal Project**: Focused on personal growth and learning, not market expansion
- **Collaboration Mode**: Stefan learns Dart hands-on while I provide guidance

### User Psychology
- Developers view testing as "waste of time" in competitive scenarios
- Hesitation to add tests comes from fear of losing momentum
- Success requires demonstrating that TDD actually makes them faster
- Minimal footprint is crucial for adoption

## Next Steps

1. **Project Setup**: Create Dart project structure (pubspec.yaml, directories, .gitignore)
2. **TDD Phase 1**: Implement TestCase class with YAML parsing
3. **TDD Phase 2**: Implement test case file loading and input extraction
4. **TDD Phase 3**: Implement test execution and output comparison
5. **FizzBuzz Example**: Create complete working example

## Active Decisions

- **Scope**: Focus on AOC puzzles specifically, not general algorithmic problems
- **Positioning**: Compete with Approval Testing by being more specialized
- **Validation**: Use time-based comparison with classic TDD approach
- **Target**: Existing TDD practitioners, not testing skeptics
- **Development Approach**: Strict TDD for the test runner itself
- **Collaboration**: Mob programming with Stefan as typist, me as navigator

## Important Patterns

- **Structured Test Files**: YAML header + raw input format
- **Minimal Setup**: Copy-paste input file, implement algorithm, run test
- **TDD Workflow**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
- **Competitive Advantage**: Speed through systematic testing approach
- **Mob Programming**: Stefan types, I navigate and explain Dart concepts
