# Project Brief

## Core Requirements

Create a Dart-based test runner specifically tailored for Advent of Code puzzles that enables Test-Driven Development (TDD) with minimal setup overhead.

## Primary Goals

1. **Reduce Boilerplate**: Eliminate repetitive setup code for input parsing, algorithm execution, and output formatting
2. **Minimize Friction**: Make it as simple as possible to add tests when puzzles become complex
3. **Enable TDD**: Support Test-Driven Development workflow for competitive programming
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Provide a testing framework that makes developers faster, not slower

## Project Scope

- **Target Users**: TDD practitioners solving Advent of Code puzzles
- **Core Functionality**: Structured test case files (YAML + input) with automated test execution
- **Platform**: Dart programming language
- **Competition**: Alternative to Approval Testing, specifically tailored for AOC puzzles

## Success Criteria

- Measurable reduction in setup time compared to standard unit testing
- Positive developer experience when adding tests mid-solution
- Successful TDD workflow for medium-difficulty AOC puzzles
- Minimal learning curve for existing TDD practitioners
