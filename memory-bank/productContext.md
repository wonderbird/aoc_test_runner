# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Advent of Code puzzles follow a consistent structure: parse input file → implement algorithm → submit string output. This repetitive pattern creates boilerplate overhead that distracts from the core problem-solving focus.

## Problems It Solves

### Primary Pain Points
- **Setup Friction**: TDD practitioners hesitate to add tests when puzzles become complex because setup feels like "waste of time"
- **Boilerplate Overhead**: Every puzzle requires similar input parsing and output formatting code
- **Context Switching**: Adding tests mid-solution interrupts algorithmic thinking flow
- **Competitive Pressure**: Time spent on setup feels like lost opportunity in leaderboard competition

### Current Solutions' Limitations
- Standard unit testing frameworks are too verbose for this use case
- Approval Testing is too general-purpose, not optimized for AOC puzzle structure
- Manual testing approaches don't scale when puzzles become complex

## User Experience Goals

### Core Experience
- **Minimal Footprint**: Start testing with absolute minimum effort
- **Seamless Integration**: Add tests without breaking problem-solving momentum
- **Immediate Value**: First test run provides instant feedback on solution correctness
- **TDD Flow**: Natural progression from failing test → implementation → refactoring

### Competitive Advantage
- **Speed**: Faster puzzle solving through reliable TDD approach
- **Confidence**: Systematic testing reduces debugging time
- **Focus**: Spend time on algorithms, not setup boilerplate

## Target User Journey

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with minimal test case for easy puzzle
2. **Scale Up**: Add more test cases as puzzle complexity increases
3. **Iterate Fast**: Use TDD cycle to explore different algorithmic approaches
4. **Submit Confidently**: Know solution is correct before submitting to AOC website
