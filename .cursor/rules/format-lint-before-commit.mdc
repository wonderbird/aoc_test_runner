description: Format and Lint before Commit
alwaysApply: false
---
When the user instructs you to commit changes to git, you MUST first

- format code and run the linter by running `dart format .` and checking its output
- execute all tests by running `dart test` and checking its output

You MUST report errors back to the user instead of committing.

You MAY only commit, if all commands above succeed.
